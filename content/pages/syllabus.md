Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Permission of instructor.

Objectives
----------

*   To understand the methods by which we can represent, propagate and infer uncertainty.
*   To explore "interdisciplinary" application.
*   To build an intellectual community around uncertainty quantification.

Topics Covered
--------------

The specific topics vary between offerings, but are generally drawn from the following:

*   Density Estimation: Exponential Family, Mixture Models, Kernels, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
*   Model Selection: Jacknife, Bootstrap, Cross-validation and Information Criteria
*   Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, ICA, and other nonlinear modes
*   Model Reduction: POD / EOF, Krylov, Response Surface Models, Polynomial Chaos
*   Inference: Hierarchical Bayes, Graphical Models
*   Time-dependent Inference: Linear, Ensemble, Mixture, Kernel, Mutual Information, and Particle Filtering and Smoothing
*   Statistical Models: Regression Machines, Gaussian Processes, Markov Models
*   Manifold Learning
*   Information Theoretic Estimation, Control and Learning

Expectations
------------

*   Attend class.
*   Read the assigned papers/readings.
*   Every participant "recites" a paper.
*   Do a project.
    *   Use a method studied here in your application.
    *   Develop a new method for applications studied here.
    *   Write a review paper in a subject area.
